# circuit_comparison

This project aims to compare various VQC architectures, as studied in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10876, in terms of their actual performance in finding the ground state wavefunction of a many-body system. Reachability to the true ground state does not only depend on [expressibility and entangling capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10876) but also on choice of optimization and initialization of parameters.
